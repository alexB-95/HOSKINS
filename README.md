# HOSKINS (Hot Subdwarf Kinematic Suite)


Collection of code to calculate and visualize stellar orbits and other kinematic properties.

This was written a few years ago as I was teaching myself python, and thus does not conform to best practices well. I plan on rewriting the code and turning it into a proper pipeline in the future.
